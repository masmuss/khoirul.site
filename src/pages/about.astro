					<p>
						Hey, I am <strong class="text-foreground">Khoirul</strong>, a full stack developer and
						photography enthusiast.
					</p>
					<p>
						Building applications that are seamless, functional, and user-friendly. Occasionally
						sharing thoughts on Web Development, Photography, and Tech Insights.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dreaming up ideas and making them come to life is where my passion lies. You can find my <a

							class="text-foreground underline underline-offset-2 hover:opacity-75"
							>full projects list here</a
						>. I also explore the art of photography, capturing moments and visual stories on <a

							target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer"
							class="text-foreground underline underline-offset-2 hover:opacity-75">Instagram</a
						>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I write <a
							href="/blog"
							class="text-foreground underline underline-offset-2 hover:opacity-75">blog posts</a
						> about coding, creativity, and my experiences. If you enjoy reading about tech or want to
						follow along, feel free to check them out.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of coding and photography, I'm always eager to learn new things, collaborate on
						projects, or just chat over coffee.
